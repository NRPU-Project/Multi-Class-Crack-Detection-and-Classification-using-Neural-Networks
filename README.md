# Multi-Class-Crack-Detection-and-Classification-using-Neural-Networks.

This work proposes an enhanced you only look once (eYOLO)v5s model to address the limitations of existing computer vision (CV) based models, specifically in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency. In addition, extra convolution, upsampling and concatenation layers were deployed to improve the model's accuracy. These architectural optimizations enable the model to capture more complex features and improve its multi-scale detection capabilities. Additionally, proposed method can classify cracks into six different categories, including branched, crocodile, diagonal, longitudinal, pothole, and transversal cracks, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of structural damage.
